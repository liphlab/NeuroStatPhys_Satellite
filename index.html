					Neurons in the brain form highly structured networks responsible for processing information. 
					Perception, decision-making, learning, memory, and ultimately conscious awareness are among the key functions 
					carried out by neural systems. To optimize performance, neural systems must achieve (during development) and 
					maintain (throughout life) a balanced state at both cellular and systemic levels, ensuring efficient information 
					processing and computational capabilities.
					<br><br>
					A fundamental question is how populations of neurons collaborate and 
					coordinate to perform functions and sustain an optimal state for information processing and computation. 
					While electrophysiological recordings in behaving animals have provided significant insights into how 
					individual neurons encode information, the collective behavior of neuronal populations remains largely unexplored. 
					How do emergent collective phenomena, such as neuronal oscillations, waves, or avalanches, contribute to function? 
					Moreover, what is the nature of the brainâ€™s internal state, and how does it influence function?
					<br><br>
					This satellite workshop aims to strengthen the interdisciplinary connection between neuroscience and statistical 
					physics by bringing together physicists and neuroscientists working on collective dynamics, cognition, and behavior. 
					The workshop will provide a platform for discussing recent theoretical, computational, and experimental advances 
					regarding the role of neural ensembles in brain function. Designed to foster discussion and collaboration, 
					the event will emphasize the inclusion of early-career researchers and ensure diversity among participants, 
					maintaining a balance between physicists, theoretical neuroscientists, and experimental neuroscientists.
